# hello-world

Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ”­ We are currently working on Eyebouâ€™s Eye Health Machine Learning Models

- ðŸŒ± About us

We are a team of AI, design, engineering and eye health specialists working to make eye care more accessible and affordable through technology. Our goal in the project is to a) collect patient data via our iOS application b) clean and analyse that data via our Rails platform c) use our open source machine learning algorithms to detect any eye health abnormalities from the data collected and assist the work of optometrists round the world to see more patients.

- ðŸ‘¯ Overview

This repo includes open source software for ML models designed to detect abnormalities in eye health such as strabismus, red eye, pterygium etc. This repo with our ML toolkit is the final stage in the Eyebou product offering. The Eyebou product begins with an iOS application that collects patient data with only the use of a mobile device and works in low or no connectivity settings which is the main use case for our software. The data is then collected into our Rails platform where we clean and label the data ready for modelling. The repo below consists of the ML algorithms to analyse new data and flag when an issue has been detected.

- ðŸ’¬ Running our software

We recommend the following hardware to run our software: Central Processing Unit (CPU) â€” Intel Core i5 6th Generation processor or higher. An AMD equivalent processor will also be optimal. RAM â€” 8 GB minimum, 16 GB or higher is recommended. Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) â€” NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960 or higher. Operating System â€” Ubuntu or Microsoft Windows 10.
